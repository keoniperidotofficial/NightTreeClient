# Night Tree Client
A open source modified client of AuguPlatformer which gives you super speed and longer mining reach so you can supposedly grief.
This may seem unfair to other players based off of your abilities.
You can use this for your personal use and in a private server but you should not use this in a public server since the game is supposed to be fair for everyone.
and still remember, if you want the original client for you to modift, head on over to Augu0107's repo. or if you want to modify this client, you can just get the code and do whatever shit you want.
and remember, this gives you unfair abilities in AuguPlatformer. so do not use this in public games. thank you. - Keoni Peridot.
